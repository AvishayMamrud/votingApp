## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the high-level architecture requirements for a web-based platform that allows users to create, vote on, and view results of surveys and polls. It defines architectural goals, technology constraints, and major components to guide system design and development.

### 1.2 Scope

The system includes a web interface for users and an API-based backend built on a modular microservices architecture. The initial deployment will be a prototype, but the design anticipates flexibility and scalability for broader use cases.

### 1.3 Document Audience

This document is intended for the project team responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the system. It includes:

* Developers
* Architects
* Product Owner / Stakeholders
* QA/Test Engineers
* DevOps (if/when applicable)

> *Note: This is distinct from the platformâ€™s **end users**, who may range from individuals in a classroom to nationwide or public audiences.*

## 2. Business Context

### 2.1 Problem Statement

There is a need for a flexible, user-friendly platform that enables real-time polling and survey functionality for various user types (e.g., public users, registered users, moderators/admins).

### 2.2 Objectives

* Provide survey and poll creation capabilities
* Allow users to vote securely and anonymously
* Display aggregated and individual results
* Ensure scalability and modularity via microservices
* Prepare the system for eventual migration or support for NoSQL data persistence

## 3. Architectural Goals

| Goal                | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**     | Handle high user traffic and voting load with minimal latency |
| **Modularity**      | Use microservices to isolate concerns (e.g., Voting, Survey Management) |
| **Maintainability** | Clean service boundaries and reusable components |
| **Flexibility**     | Allow DB technology swap (e.g., RDBMS â†’ NoSQL) |
| **Security**        | Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to simplify permission management. RBAC is chosen over alternatives due to its clarity, ease of implementation, and suitability for typical platform roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator). More complex models like ABAC can be introduced later if necessary. |
| **Extensibility**   | Future support for analytics, moderation, sharing, etc. |

---

## 4. Assumptions

* Initial version will be deployed in a single region (cloud or local)
* Users access the system via modern browsers (React frontend)
* Stateless services wherever possible
* Service communication via HTTP/REST initially
* Authentication will use JWT-based token flow

---

## 5. Constraints

* Backend will be implemented in **C#**
* Frontend will be developed using **React**
* Initial persistence layer is **Relational (MySQL)**; the system must remain open to switching to NoSQL
* Avoid cloud or vendor lock-in when possible

### 7.2 External Dependencies (Initial Phase)

* **Relational Database**: MySQL (hosted locally or on cloud)
* **Authentication Provider**: JWT-based token system (internal or via OAuth later)
* **Deployment Platform**: Localhost or containerized environment (Docker)

> *Note: Caching (e.g., Redis) and logging/monitoring stacks are not part of the initial prototype, but can be added as the system evolves.*
